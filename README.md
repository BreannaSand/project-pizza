Pizzeria Project 
This is a simple javascript program for a pizzeria's customer to make an order. The customer gets to choose their food off of a menu as well as if it's a kids or adult's meal. They are given an order confirmation and they are able to deny or accept it. I used prompts and alerts for user interaction and input. I used if statements and a switch case for storing variables in the logical operations.
